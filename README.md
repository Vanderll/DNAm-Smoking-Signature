# DNAm-Smoking-Signature

This repository is for the code to make the DNAm smoking signatures as well as all the analyses.  

* getDNAm_smokingSignature.Rmd:  This is code to calculating the McCartney and Reese scores.  
* getDNAm_smokingSignature_ML.Rmd: We later found the Rauschert paper and wanted to include this score as well.  This is creating the Rauschert score with our DNAm data.
* exploreDNAm_smokingSignature_v4.Rmd: This has the statistical analyses.
